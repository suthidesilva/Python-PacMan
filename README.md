# Spaceman Game

The Spaceman game is a simple, interactive text-based game written in Python. Players try to guess a secret word one letter at a time. But be careful! You only have a limited number of attempts to guess correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using a Python interpreter (Python 3.x is recommended).
2. The game will show you how many letters the secret word contains.
3. Start guessing one letter at a time. If the letter is in the word, the game reveals its position(s).
4. If you guess a letter wrong, you lose one attempt.
5. Keep guessing letters until you can solve the word or you run out of attempts.

## Installation

No additional libraries are required to play this game. Just make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

To download and run the game:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suthidesilva/Python-PacMan
